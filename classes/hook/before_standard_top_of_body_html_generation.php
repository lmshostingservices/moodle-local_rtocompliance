/**
 * Shows site administrators a repair banner while the recorded plugin version is
 * stranded above the version the installed files declare.
 *
 * Why this hook: a higher stored version does NOT put Moodle into upgrade mode
 * (moodle_needs_upgrading() only reacts to a LOWER one), so the site runs normally
 * and the fault is completely silent — right up until someone tries to install an
 * update and is told "A higher version of this plugin is already installed".
 * Surfacing it on every admin page is what turns a mystery into a one-click fix.
